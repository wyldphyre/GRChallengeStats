# GRChallengeStats
A simple app to provide statistics related to the GoodReads Reading Challenge.

Currently only a command line app exists. It is implemented in .Net Core 3.1 and will run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Road Map

- More the statistics and common objects into a librray
- Implement a desktop app
- Implement a mobile app
