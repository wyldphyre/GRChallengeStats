# GRChallengeStats
A simple app to provide statistics related to the GoodReads Reading Challenge.

## Command line app

It is implemented in .Net Core 3.1 and will run on Windows, Mac (untested), and Linux (untested).

## Windows Desktop App

This is a work in progress, but works for the current years challenge.

## Road Map

- ~~Move the statistics and common objects into a library~~
- Implement a desktop app
  - Implement target editing
  - Implement managing a list of years
  - Implement manually adding a new year
- Implement a mobile app
